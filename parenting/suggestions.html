          So if you’re worried about your child being aggressive, the answer doesn’t seem to be as simple as not letting them play video games entirely. Instead, it is more the content of the video games that matters. Remarkably, it seems that prosocial video games actually have a slightly greater affect on your child than violent video games do. 

          Then what can we do as parents to help counter these effects? Also, many video games are not strictly prosocial or violent, which brings up other questions such as: “What about games in the middle, such as a violent game to help save the world?” and “What if my child plays games in teams with their friends?” Amazingly, more recent studies show that adding this prosocial aspect to violent video games can actually help minimize their negative effects. In other words, this research suggests that playing violent games in teams, or for a helpful purpose, can make them healthier for children to play. However, it seems that the best thing we can do in terms of making children more helpful long-term is to actually buy them prosocial video games, not just to take their violent games away.
